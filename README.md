# MouseLock GUI

### Locks the mouse pointer at the center of the screen until a specified key is pressed.

------------------

## 👋 Introduction

The main idea behind the development of this program was to lock the mouse pointer when playing old video games that didn't lock the mouse and that caused problems.

You may find different needs to lock the mouse. 

This is a very old project, with ugly source-code, and probably I will not renew it.

## 👌 Features

 - Automatically locks the mouse when MouseLock program runs.

 - Automatically locks the mouse at certain hour.

 - Automatically locks the mouse when a specified process is running.

 - Set a single key or combination key to unlock the mouse.

 - Set a initial delay to start locking the mouse.
